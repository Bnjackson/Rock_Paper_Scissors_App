Rock Paper Scissors game with UI

I had already made a rock paper scissors game that was played in the console. I took that code added the HTML and CSS, I then adpated the JavaScript to use DOM methods instead of the console. 

This project improved my knowledge of DOM manipulation, problem solving and reworking old code.
